This is a simple login system written in C language. The purpose of this system is to authenticate users before granting them access to a system or application. The login system is designed to be secure, efficient, and easy to use.

Getting Started
To get started with the login system, you will need to download the source code files and compile them using a C compiler such as gcc. Once you have compiled the code, you can run the executable to start the login system.

Usage
When you run the login system, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. If your username and password are correct, you will be granted access to the system. If your username or password is incorrect, you will be prompted to try again.

The login system allows you to create new user accounts, delete existing user accounts, and modify user account information such as usernames and passwords.

Security
The login system uses password hashing to securely store user passwords. Passwords are hashed using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which is a secure one-way hash function. This means that even if the password file is compromised, the passwords cannot be easily recovered.

Limitations
The login system is a simple implementation of a login system and is not intended to be used in production environments. It is designed for educational purposes only and should not be used as a primary means of securing a system or application.
Acknowledgments
This login system was inspired by the need to provide a simple yet effective way to authenticate users in C language. Special thanks to the developers who have contributed to the open-source community and made this project possible.
